Advent of Code 2023 Attempts and Solutions

Most solutions work. If there's a `solve2.py` in there, that's probably the solution for the second half. Otherwise, `solve.py` probably solves both.

## Solutions that don't work
### Early Days
I'm pretty sure I just overwote part one to do part two, because it was pretty simple. Nothing very interesting in those, anyways.

### Day 12
I haven't solved part 2 of this yet - and I'm not 100 percent sure of the state of the part one solver as I've been messing with part two. I solved part one using a mostly-stupid enumeration of the search space.

## Other days of interest 
### Day 17
There's what I consider to be a really elegant encoding of the problem into shorteset path. There's a much less elegant but much more performant encoding in there also.
